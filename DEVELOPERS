==== Coding Style ====

To contribute to seed, the developers needs to be aware of some coding style rules.

It's basically based on the coding style from Mozilla [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style] with
a few differences.

So, tl:dl:
    * Use four spaces to indent.
    * Indent after brakets
    * Pointers always on left of var name, glues to the type.


To ease the developer's life, there's a .clang-format to autoformat the source code. Developers are invited to used that tool
before submitting a patch.

To use that tool, call:
    clang-format -i filename.c
