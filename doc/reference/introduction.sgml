What Seed is all about

<para>
Seed is a library and interpreter, dynamically bridging (through gobject-introspection) the WebKit JavaScriptCore engine with the GObject type system. In a more concrete sense, Seed enables you to immediately write applications around a significant portion of the GNOME platform, and easily embed JavaScript as a scripting language in your GObject library. Seed is built around the idea of "minimal-platform", in that it seems a theoretically ideal GNOME development language provides no platform of its own, but instead seamlessly integrates with the already quite large GNOME platform.
