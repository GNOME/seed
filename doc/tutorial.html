<p>Seed, first and foremost, provides an easily embeddable Javascript engine to developers looking for a straightforward way to create extensible applications. It also provides bindings between <a href="#">GObject</a> and the <a href="#">WebKit</a> Javascript engine, giving new developers access to the power of the GNOME stack from a familiar and simple language, and allowing rapid prototyping of applications for hardened GNOME developers.</p>
<p>This tutorial begins with a few brief examples, and then dives right in, following the development of a simple Seed program, from beginning to end. By the end of the tutorial, you'll have your very own minimalist audio player, as well as a summary knowledge of the use of Seed to build Gtk+ applications.</p>
<div class="section">Beginning Seed</div>
<p>It makes sense to start our exploration with a program you're probably quite familiar with:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/seed

Seed.print("Hello, world!");
</pre>
<p>If you were to make this script executable (<code>chmod +x hello.js</code>), and run it, you'd hopefully see the following, just as expected (if you don't, for some reason, make sure you have the latest version of Seed installed, then <a href="#">email us</a>):</p>
<pre>
Hello, world!
</pre>
<p>Make sure that you include the header (<code>#!/usr/local/seed</code>) at the top of every Seed program you write; I'm only going to include it when listing a whole file, from now on. This is what tells the shell that it should run the program using <code>seed</code>, and that <code>seed</code> is installed to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> (you'll recognize this if you've used another scripting language, such as Python).
<p>Variables in Javascript are rather interesting, in that they are not given any <em>type</em>, and conversion between different kinds of values is automatic and painless. Thus, the following code is perfectly valid:</p>
<pre>
my_name = Seed.readline("Your name? ");
my_age = 25;
Seed.print(my_name + " is " + my_age);
</pre>
