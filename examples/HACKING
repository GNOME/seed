The goal of this file is to tell you what each example serves as an example of, or a list of what kind of examples we have.

== External Examples ==

The Lights Off example now lives in the gnome-games module. It uses Clutter,
	with custom animations, SVGs, GConf, etc.

== Large Examples ==

browser/
	- An incomplete WebKit-based web browser. Uses much of Gtk and WebKit.

clutter-pad/
	- A scratchpad for Seed+Clutter scripts, using GtkSourceView and GtkBuilder.

clutter-shader/
	- A GLSL shader example. Utilizes Gtk with Clutter, GtkSourceView,
	  ClutterTexture, and Clutter Shader.

clutter-transitions/
	- A library of interesting slide transition animations; many are similar to
	  those found in Keynote. Makes heavy use of Clutter 0.8.

glib/
	- A small collection of examples that utilize interesting parts of GLib.
	  Threading, timeouts/timers, and reading the enivronment are all covered.

opengl/
	- Examples which use OpenGL-GLib. Includes the classic GLUT teapot, a Seed
	  port of glxgears, and a simple colored triangle.

pong/
	- An incomplete implementation of Pong in Clutter.

same-seed/
	- An in-progress Clutter port of Same Gnome. Makes heavy use of the new 
	  Clutter 0.9 API, which is signficantly different from our older examples,
	  which all use Clutter 0.8.

turtle/
	- Written in C, exposes an interface to Javascript as an embedding language.
	  Simple turtle graphics demo.

twitter/
	- A simple Gtk Twitter client which was introduced in Ars Technica's article
	  on Seed. Uses async network access, John Resig's pretty.js, etc.

xml/
	- Various examples that use the libxml C module to walk the DOM, perform
	  XPath queries, etc.
