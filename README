=== Seed README ===

Seed is a library and interpreter, dynamically bridging (through gobject-introspection) the WebKit JavaScriptCore engine with the GObject type system. In a more concrete sense, Seed enables you to immediately write applications around a significant portion of the GNOME platform, and easily embed JavaScript as a scripting language in your GObject library.
